                current Nodcredit customer, you can also use our Privacy Notice as a guide to the ways we use your

                terms and conditions of this privacy policy and any updates we make. Our Terms of Use take precedent
                over any provision conflicting with our privacy policy. This is our complete privacy policy, and
                supersedes all earlier versions.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is written to apply to Nodens Nigeria Limited and its affiliates now or in the
                future.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h5>
            <p>We update our Privacy Policy regularly—this version is effective as of the date indicated above. We will
                notify you of material changes to the Privacy Policy by email as well as a notice on our website.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>1. How And Why We Collect Infomation About You</h4>
            <br>
            <h5>1.1. Information You Provide Us</h5>
            <h6>1.1.1. Personal Information</h6>
            <br>
            <p>We collect personal information from you to help you use our services. When we say “personal
                information,” we mean information that specifically identifies you.</p>
            <p>We collect this information in a number of ways. You are asked to provide personal information to us
                while submitting loan applications, registering to use our Website, discussing your application with
                us, providing feedback to us, or transferring funds when using our services. Examples of personal
                information include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your Name</li>
                <li>Your Address</li>
                <li>Telephone Number</li>
                <li>Email Address</li>

            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>We may supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third-party
                sources. For example, in an effort to protect the integrity of your account and if permitted under
                applicable law, we may supplement your registration Information with address standardization data to
                verify the address you have entered is valid and to protect you against identity theft.</p>
            <p>Finally, we never intend to collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we
                learn or are notified that we have collected this information from a child under the age of 13, we
                will promptly remove the data from our system.</p>


            <p> <br></p>
            <h5>1.2. Information We Collect About You</h5>

                services.</p>

            <p>In the case of employee-sponsored plans, where we partner with employers to offer our products to

            <br>
            <h6>1.2.3. Website Use And Logging Data</h6>
            <p>Nodcredit also collects information about your computer or mobile device to improve and evaluate your
                use of our website and our services. We may gather data such as your browser type, operating system,
                loading or exiting of web pages, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or device.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>1.2.4. Information We Get From Others</h6>
            <p>Like other advertisers, we contract with third parties to place advertisements for our products and
                services on websites that are not our own. We place these ads where we think they are likely to be
                most relevant. These advertisements on third-party websites allow us to track responses to our ads.
                We and our affiliates use this information to track the performance of our advertising and marketing
                campaigns by using tools like cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. We use these tools to
                collect and store information about your visits, page visits and duration, and the specific ad or
                link that the user clicked on to visit the site.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>1.2.5 Cookies</h6>
            <p>Nodcredit uses “cookies” and similar tools to track your use of the Website when you use our
                services. We collect information such as the types of service used, and number of users we receive
                daily. Our web servers automatically log information about your computer, but we don’t use this
                information to identify you personally.</p>
            <p>We and our vendors use cookies and to improve our service, our site and to provide more convenient
                and relevant experiences to you. Cookies are designed to transfer a small amount of data to your
                browser by servers within a domain. That data is only read by designated servers within that domain.
                It functions as your computer’s identification card and enables Nodcredit to improve your experience
                by securely maintaining your authenticated session and preferences.</p>
            <p>A web beacon embeds a small transparent gif image in a web page or email used to track when the page
                or email has been viewed. A similar device may be used where a product, service or functionality
                sends data to a server when a set of user-initiated events occur such as clicking a button on the
                website or in an email. This is similar to a cookie – it tracks your visit and the data is only read
                by the server that receives the data. However, it differs because it is not browser-based, may not
                function as an ID card and doesn’t store any data on your computer.</p>
            <p>Most Internet browsers are set up to accept cookies automatically. You can set your browser to notify
                you when you receive a cookie, allowing you to decide whether or not to accept it. For some web
                pages requiring an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies or
                similar devices will probably not be able to access those pages or their products and services.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>1.2.6 Contacting us by Telephone</h6>
            <p>If you communicate with us by telephone, we may monitor or record the call. This is done for reasons
                such as maintaining the integrity of your account, providing effective and timely service, and the
                improvement of Nodcredit’s products.</p>

            <h4>3. Protecting Your Personal Information</h4>

            <h6>3.1 What we do to protect your personal information</h6>
            <p>Nodcredit takes the privacy and security of its members personal information seriously. We maintain
                administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect your information’s security,
                confidentiality and integrity.</p>
            <p>We protect personal information you provide online in connection with registering yourself as a user
                of our website. Access to your own personal information is available through a unique user ID and
                password selected by you. This password is encrypted while transmitted from your browser to our
                servers and while stored on our systems. To protect the security of your personal information, never
                share your password to anyone. Please notify us immediately if you believe your password has been
                compromised.</p>
            <p>Whenever we save your personal information, it’s stored on servers and in facilities that only
                selected Nodcredit personnel and our contractors have access to. We encrypt all data that you submit
                through Nodcredit’s website during transmission using Transport Layer Security (TLS) in order to
                prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. Remember all information you submit to
                us by email is not secure, so please do not send sensitive information in any email to Nodcredit. We
                never request that you submit sensitive or personal information over email, so please report any
                such requests to us by sending an email to <a
                    href="mailto:secuirty@nodcredit.com">secuirty@nodcredit.com</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>3.2 Steps you can take to help us keep your information safe</h6>
            <p>There are many steps you can take to help us keep your information safe. First and foremost, choose
                complex, independent passwords for each website and service you maintain an account with. This helps
                keep any breach of any of your accounts isolated to one service. Also, don’t use anything related to
                your birthday, address, phone number, PIN number or any other easily guessable information in your
                password.</p>
            <p>Nodcredit urges your caution when using a public computers or networks, like at a coffee shop or
                library. To best protect your personal information and login information, don’t use such computers
                to access your sensitive accounts, and if you must do, ensure that you logout of your account
                entirely.</p>
            <p>When either you or we update information in your account, such as the status of a loan application,
                we typically send you notice of these changes via email or text message. In recent years,
                individuals, businesses and even governments have seen a rise in “phishing” attacks. Phishing occurs
                when someone attempts to obtain your password or other sensitive information. Scammers often do this
                by impersonating a trusted user, or offering a compelling reason to open a malicious email
                attachment, click on a link or give over information. We never ask for your sensitive personal
                information, such as password, over email or other unsecure methods or through any site not under
                the Nodcredit.com domain. Please notify us at <a
                    href="mailto:secuirty@nodcredit.com">security@nodcredit.com</a> if you ever receive suspicious
                correspondence from us.</p>


            <br>
